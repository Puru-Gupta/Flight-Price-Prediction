## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I was interested in Flight Airfare Prediction listings to help tourists find the right flight airfare based on their needs.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

I have used Kaggle Flight Price prediction Dataset used to predict the flight prices. This dataset consists of 10683 records with 13 columns that explain about the flight in India by some Indian and foreign Airlines in 2019. We will analyze this dataset using Machine learning techniques in order to predict the flight ticket price based on the features provided in the columns of the dataset. We will begin the Data Science Life Cycle to process the data such as Cleaning the dataset, feature engineering, splitting dataset, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found below

## 3. Modelling and Evaluation

* Algorithms used
  * Random Forest
  * Gradient Boost Method


* Metric - Since the target variable is a continuous variable, regression evaluation metric RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R2 Score (Coefficient of Determination) have been used.
